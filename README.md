# Module 2 Challenge: Ryan Caltabiano's Portfolio

## Description

This website was designed as a place to host all of the projects I'm to complete over the course of my
time in bootcamp as well as all projects going forward. At this point, the site houses several placeholders
for future projects but does include some of the HTML/CSS work I've completed in the last module. The theme
I used for this site is carnivorous plants because it's something I'm very interested in and it's something
I work with regularly. As the course progresses and my skills develop, I intend to change most of the elements of this site as well as its appearance. I used the module as a means to experiment with different styles but wanted to challenge myself to try to replicate the overall layout presented in the gif at the same time. I did that both to challenge myself and with the idea that clients would request particular elements in their webpages. Going forward, I plan to separate projects by type, have more interactive elements introduced, and fine tune the layout to be more dynamic as the window shrinks in size. As it currently sits, there are three different layouts I created based on needs. The standard was designed in 4k,
but there are options for 768px as well as 480px for tablet and phone users. The website was designed without any source code and was an excellent challenge to develop my skillset.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This site is used as a central storage for all projects I intend to complete both through bootcamp and going forward. The navigation bar at the top allows the user to quickly access the information they would like to see on the page. The images act as links to the live projects that I have completed that the user can quickly access. In the contact me section, I have included links that allow the user to quickly call, email, or view my GitHub respository.
